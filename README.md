# P4
Presented here is the code used in the 4th semester project. The code is written in plain text and is intended to be copy/pasted into the MATLAB editor. To run the code, MATLAB's [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) must be installed.


## Thin-Film
### Single-Layer Anti-Reflective Coating
* [Method 2](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Single-Layer/Method%202)
### Multilayer High-Reflective Coating
* [Method 2](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Multilayer/Method%202)


## Photonic Crystals
### 1-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
* [Analytical Model](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Analytical%20Model%20)
* [Plane Wave Expansion](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Plane%20Wave%20Expansion)
* [Off Axis Propagation](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Off%20Axis%20Propagation)
  * For this code it is recommended to add the command "print('OffAxis','-dpng','-r300');" to save the image in the MATLAB folder, since the scatter plot figure can be inconsistent.
### 2-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
* [Square Lattice of Bars](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Square%20Lattice%20of%20Bars)

* [Square Lattice of Rods](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Square%20Lattice%20of%20Rods)

* [Hexagonal Lattice of Rods](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Hexagonal%20Lattice%20of%20Rods)
