# Modelling Anti-Reflective and High Reflective Materials Made of Dielectric Thin-Film Coatings of Si3N4 & SiO2 and Using Theoretical Models of Photonic Crystals to Predict Bandgaps in Periodic Dielectric Materials
Presented here is the code used in the 4th semester project. The code is written in plain text and is intended to be copy/pasted into the MATLAB editor. To run the code, MATLAB's [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) must be installed.


## Thin-Film
### Single-Layer Anti-Reflective Coating
* [Method 1](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Single-Layer/Method%201)
* [Method 2](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Single-Layer/Method%202)
### Multilayer High-Reflective Coating
* [Method 1](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Multilayer/Method%201)
* [Method 2](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Multilayer/Method%202)
* [High Reflection Data Prediction - Silicon](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Multilayer/High%20Reflection%20Data%20Prediction%20-%20Silicon)
* [High Reflective Data Prediction - Glass](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/Thin-Film/Multilayer/High%20Reflective%20Data%20Prediction%20-%20Glass)


## Photonic Crystals
### 1-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
* [Analytical Model (with angles)](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Analytical%20Model%20)
* [Plane Wave Expansion](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Plane%20Wave%20Expansion)
* [Off Axis Propagation](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/1D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Off%20Axis%20Propagation)
  * For this code it is recommended to add the command "print('OffAxis','-dpng','-r300');" to save the image in the MATLAB folder, since the scatter plot figure can be inconsistent.
### 2-Dimensional Photonic Crystals
* [Square Lattice of Bars](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Square%20Lattice%20of%20Bars)

* [Square Lattice of Rods](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Square%20Lattice%20of%20Rods)

* [Hexagonal Lattice of Rods](https://github.com/5-321/P4/blob/main/2D%20Photonic%20Crystals/Hexagonal%20Lattice%20of%20Rods)
